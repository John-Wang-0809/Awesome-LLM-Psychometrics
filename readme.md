## 🧠 Constructs & Categories  

![](./test.png)

### 📂 Personality 

- 🗯️ **Big Five	/	HEXACO	/	Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)	/	Dark Triad	/	Others & custom**
- 🧪 **Personality** is the enduring configuration of characteristics and behavior that comprises an individual’s unique adjustment to life.

### 📂 Values  

- ⚖️ **Schwartz’s Theory	/	World Values Survey (WVS)	/	Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE)	/	Social Value Orientation (SVO)	/	Others & custom**
- 🧪 **Values** are enduring beliefs that guide behavior and decision-making, reflecting what is important and desirable to an individual or group.

### 📂 Morality  

- 🧬 **Moral Foundations (MFT) 	/	 Defining Issues Test (DIT)	/	ETHICS	/	Others & custom**
- 🧪 **Morality** is the categorization of intentions, decisions and actions into those that are proper, or right, and those that are improper, or wrong.

### 📂 Attitudes & Opinions  

- 🗣️ **American National Election Studies (ANES)	/	 American Trends Panel(ATP)	/	German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES)	/	 Political Compass Test (PCT)**

- 🧪 **Attitudes** are always attitudes about something. This implies three necessary elements: first, there is the object of thought, which is both constructed and evaluated. Second, there are acts of construction and evaluation. Third, there is the agent, who is doing the constructing and evaluating. We can therefore suggest that, at its most general, an attitude is the cognitive construction and affective evaluation of an attitude object by an agent.

  

### 📂 Heuristics & Biases

- 🧪  **Heuristics and biases** are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that simplify decision-making and problem-solving.

### 📂 Social Intelligence & Theory of Mind  

- 🌀 **Theory of Mind (ToM)	/	Emotional Intelligence	/	Social Intelligence**

- 🧪 **Theory of Mind** is the ability to attribute mental states such as beliefs, intentions, and knowledge to others.

  🧪 **Emotional Intelligence** is the subset of social intelligence that involves the ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions.

  🧪 **Social Intelligence** is the ability to understand and manage people.

### 📂 Psychology of language

- **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Language  comprehension	/	Language generation	/	Language acquisition**

### 📂 Learning and cognitive capabilities
